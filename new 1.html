<h1>#1</h1>
 
<p style="font-size: 25px">March 5, 2020. I still somewhat remember the day this photo was taken, galing pala to kay Eo,
you know nmn the troops malakas mang-asar yan sila e. Anyway, during this time ata we were 
making a project, sorry mukhang wala ata ako natulong...Pero, when I see this picture, I am
reminded of how far our distance is when the topic is technology and the internet. To a 
dinosaur, you are a God. I remember being so impressed nung inedit mo ung supposed 1x1 ko sa
bus depot ng vmall. You fixed my hair, and made me even more handsome. Ung Witcher 3 bebetime 
natin, I swear love, every action na ginagawa ko I ask you. I am that confident with you sa 
ganire kaya I understand na totga mo ang STEM, kasi kahit isang beses lng nagkaroon ng tech-
related na subject here, you'd definitely do well dun. Thank you for helping this dinosaur out love. 
Sa pagedit mo for me gamit ang imong esteemed Canva Premium to guiding me sa pag download ko ng mga 
torrent,to my number 1 tech support professional, I hope you can be proud of this po hehe.
